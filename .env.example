## This configuration assumes you are running `pnpm dev`, ie. running both @cap/web and @cap/desktop locally.
## If you are only running @cap/desktop, comment out entries underneath '@cap/web + @cap/desktop'
## and uncomment entries underneath 'only @cap/desktop'
## Make sure to read the instructions on each section carefully, or you may incorrectly configure your environment.

## Database

# @cap/web supports connecting to either MySQL or Planetscale databases.
# For plain MySQL, just define DATABASE_URL (this default points to the database created by `pnpm dev`)
DATABASE_URL='mysql://root:@localhost:3306/planetscale'
# For Planetscale, define both a https:// DATABASE_URL and mysql:// DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL
# DATABASE_URL='https://{username}:{password}@aws.connect.psdb.cloud/{db-name}' # https:// identifies this as a PS connection string
# DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL='mysql://{username}:{password}@aws.connect.psdb.cloud/{db-name}?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":false}' # necessary as migrations can't be performed over https

# Encrypts users' custom S3 credentials.
# Generate a value by running `openssl rand -hex 32`

# Set to false to make new uploaded videos private by default. If not set or set to true, videos are public by default.
