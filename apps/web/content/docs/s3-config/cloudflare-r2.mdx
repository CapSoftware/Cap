## Step 1: Open Cap Desktop and Access the Cap Apps Tab

1. **Open the Cap Desktop App**: Click the Cap icon on your desktop or launch it from your applications folder.
2. **Go to Cap Apps**: Once the app is open, look for the "Cap Apps" tab in the Settings menu.

## Step 2: Choose S3 Config and Start Configuration

1. **Click on S3 Config**: Within the Cap Apps section, locate "S3 Config."
2. **Begin Configuration**: Click "Configure."
3. **Select Cloudflare R2**: From the list of storage services, pick "Cloudflare R2."

## Step 3: Set Up Your Cloudflare R2 Bucket

Before connecting to Cap, ensure you have a Cloudflare R2 bucket ready:

1. **Create or Access Your R2 Bucket**:

   - Log in to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
   - Navigate to **Storage → R2**.
   - If you don’t have a bucket yet, click "Create Bucket."
   - Provide a unique bucket name (e.g., `my-cap-uploads`) and select a region (`auto` or your preferred option).
   - Click "Create Bucket."

2. **Generate R2 Access Keys**:

   - In the R2 dashboard, find the "Access Keys" section.
   - Click "Create Access Key" and name it (e.g., `cap-app-user`).
   - Copy both the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** immediately. You won’t be able to view the secret key again later.

3. **Configure Bucket Permissions**:
   By default, Cloudflare R2 keys come with broad permissions. If you need more controlled access:

   - Check Cloudflare’s [R2 documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) for guidance on applying custom access policies.
   - Ensure that your R2 keys have at least **Read**, **Write**, and **List** permissions for the selected bucket.

4. **Set CORS Rules (Optional)**:
   If you’re serving content directly from the bucket via a browser (e.g., sharing publicly accessible links):
   - Go to your R2 bucket’s settings and locate **CORS Rules**.
   - Add rules that allow `GET`, `HEAD`, and `PUT` from domains like `https://cap.so`, `https://www.cap.so`, `https://cap.link`, and `https://www.cap.link`.
   - This ensures that assets load smoothly if accessed directly from a browser.

## Step 4: Enter Your Cloudflare R2 Details in Cap Desktop

1. Return to the "R2 Config" section in Cap Desktop.
2. Fill in the following information:
   - **Access Key ID**: Paste the key ID from the R2 dashboard.
   - **Secret Access Key**: Paste the corresponding secret key.
   - **Endpoint**: Usually follows `https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`. Find the exact endpoint in your R2 bucket details.
   - **Bucket Name**: The name of your R2 bucket (e.g., `my-cap-uploads`).
   - **Region**: R2 often uses `auto`. Check your bucket details to confirm.

## Step 5: Test and Save Your Connection

1. **Test Connection**: Click "Test Connection" in Cap Desktop to verify that it can communicate with your R2 bucket successfully.
2. **Save Configuration**: Once you see a successful connection message, save your settings.

With these steps completed, Cap Desktop will now use your Cloudflare R2 bucket to store and serve assets, giving you full control over how and where your content is hosted.
