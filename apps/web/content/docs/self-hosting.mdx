Cap Web is our web application for uploading and sharing Caps - it's what runs right here on [cap.so](https://cap.so).
You can upload videos to it from the dashboard or from Cap Desktop.

This guide describes our two supported deployment methods, how to connect Cap Desktop,
and how to configure email login links.

## Deployment Methods

### Deploying with Railway

One-click deployment via Railway is the easiest way to deploy Cap Web.
The button below will take you to the Cap Web Railway template,
which will deploy the Cap Web Docker image, a MySQL database,
and [MinIO](https://min.io) for storing videos.

Once deployed, login email links will be available in Railwayâ€™s Deploy Logs.

### Custom Deployment with Docker

The [Cap Web Docker image](https://github.com/CapSoftware/Cap/pkgs/container/cap-web)
allows you to deploy Cap Web anywhere you like.
You will need to connect your own MySQL database and S3-compatible storage.
Refer to the [Docker Compose template](https://github.com/CapSoftware/Cap/blob/main/docker-compose.template.yml)
for an example setup, including necessary environment variables.

## Connecting Cap Desktop

Copy the URL of your Cap Web deployment, and set the 'Cap Server URL'
in Cap Desktop's settings page to this URL.
Uploads from Cap Desktop will now be sent to your Cap Web deployment.

## Email Login Links

If the `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM_DOMAIN` environment variables are not set,
login links will be written to the server logs.
To send login links via email, you'll need to configure [Resend](https://resend.com):

1. Create an account at [Resend](https://resend.com)
2. Connect a domain and set it as `RESEND_FROM_DOMAIN`
3. Generate an API key and set it as `RESEND_API_KEY`
