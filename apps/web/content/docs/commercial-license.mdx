# Cap Desktop's Commercial License

The Cap Desktop application you can download from our [download page](/download) is free to use,
but requires a commercial license to be used for commercial purposes.
You can obtain a commercial license by purchasing them standalone,
or by purchasing Cap Pro. For more information, see [our pricing page](/pricing).

This license does **not** apply to versions of the app you build yourself from our [source code](https://github.com/CapSoftware/Cap),
only to binaries that **we distribute**.

## What Are Commercial Purposes?

We define commercial purposes as any use of Cap Desktop for recording or editing content that will be used as part of revenue-generating activities.
This includes but is not limited to:

- Producing content for promotion or demonstration of your employer's product or service
- Producing content for communication between team members of a company
