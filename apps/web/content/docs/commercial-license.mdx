The Cap Desktop application you can download from our [download page](/download) is free to use,
but requires a commercial license to be used for commercial purposes.
You can obtain a commercial license by purchasing them standalone,
or by purchasing Cap Pro. For more information, see [our pricing page](/pricing).

This license does **not** apply to versions of the app you build yourself from our [source code](https://github.com/CapSoftware/Cap),
only to binaries that **we distribute**.

This includes but is not limited to:

- Producing content for promotion or demonstration of your employer's product or service
