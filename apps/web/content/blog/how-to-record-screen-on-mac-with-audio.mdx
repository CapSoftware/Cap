Recording your screen on a Mac is easy. Recording it *with audio* — especially internal system audio — is where most people get stuck.

macOS doesn't make this obvious. Cmd+Shift+5, Apple's built-in screen recorder, can capture microphone audio but won't capture what's playing through your speakers or headphones. If you're recording a demo, a tutorial, or anything where the viewer needs to hear what's on screen, you need a different approach.

Here's everything you need to know.

## Why Mac Screen Recording with Audio Is Complicated

The short version: Apple restricts system audio capture by default for privacy and copyright reasons.

When you use Cmd+Shift+5 or QuickTime to record your screen, you can:
- Record video of your screen ✅
- Record your microphone ✅
- Record system audio (what's playing through speakers) ❌

To capture system audio with Apple's tools, you need a virtual audio device like BlackHole or Loopback — which involves terminal commands, Audio MIDI Setup configuration, and remembering to switch everything back when you're done.

Or you can skip all of that and use Cap.

## Method 1: Cap — Screen Recording with Audio in 2 Clicks

[Cap](https://cap.so) handles Mac system audio capture natively. No virtual audio drivers, no Audio MIDI Setup, no configuration.

**How to record your Mac screen with audio using Cap:**

1. **Download Cap** from [cap.so/download](https://cap.so/download) and install it
2. **Click the Cap icon** in your menu bar
3. **Enable "Record System Audio"** — this captures everything playing through your Mac
4. **Optionally enable your microphone** if you want to narrate while recording
5. **Select your recording area** — full screen, a specific window, or a custom region
6. **Click Start Recording**

When you stop, Cap generates a shareable link instantly. No exporting, no uploading — your link is live the moment recording stops.

**Why Cap is the best option:**

- Works on macOS Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey and all M-series chips (M1, M2, M3, M4)
- No kernel extensions or virtual audio devices required
- Records system audio and microphone on separate tracks — adjust levels independently in the editor
- Free to use with no recording time limits
- Open source — [github.com/CapSoftware/Cap](https://github.com/CapSoftware/Cap)

## Method 2: QuickTime + BlackHole (Free but Technical)

If you prefer Apple's built-in QuickTime, you can route system audio through BlackHole, a free virtual audio driver.

**Setup steps:**

1. Install BlackHole: run `brew install blackhole-2ch` in Terminal (requires Homebrew)
2. Open **Audio MIDI Setup** (search in Spotlight)
3. Click the **+** button and choose **Create Multi-Output Device**
4. Check both your normal output (speakers/headphones) and BlackHole 2ch
5. Open **System Preferences → Sound → Output** and select the Multi-Output Device
6. Open QuickTime Player, go to **File → New Screen Recording**
7. Click the dropdown arrow next to the record button and select **BlackHole 2ch** as the microphone
8. Record your screen

**The catch:** You need to remember to switch your audio output back to normal speakers when you're done, otherwise your Mac will have no audio output. It's also a multi-step process every time you want to record.

## Method 3: OBS Studio (Free, Powerful, Complex)

OBS Studio is the standard for professional recording and live streaming. It can record system audio on Mac, but the setup is non-trivial.

You'll need BlackHole installed (same as Method 2), then configure OBS to use it as an audio capture source. OBS gives you complete control over scenes, multiple sources, and output formats — but it's significant overkill if you just want to record your screen with audio and share it.

## Comparison: Mac Screen Recording with Audio Options

| Method | System Audio | Microphone | Complexity | Cost |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------|------|
| **Cap** | ✅ Built-in | ✅ | Simple | Free |
| Cmd+Shift+5 | ❌ | ✅ | Simple | Free |
| QuickTime + BlackHole | ✅ | ✅ | Complex | Free |
| OBS Studio | ✅ (with BlackHole) | ✅ | Complex | Free |
| Loopback | ✅ | ✅ | Medium | $99 |

## Recording Both Microphone and System Audio Simultaneously

With Cap, both audio sources are captured at the same time and stored on separate tracks. In the Cap editor, you can:

- Adjust the volume of system audio independently from your microphone
- Increase or decrease dB gain to fix quiet or loud audio
- Mute either track entirely for a section

This is particularly useful for tutorials where you're narrating (microphone) while demonstrating software that has its own sound effects or music (system audio).

## Common Issues and Fixes

**"System audio option is greyed out or missing"**

Make sure you've granted Cap screen recording permission. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording** and ensure Cap is checked. You may need to restart Cap after granting permission.

**"My recording has no audio at all"**

Check that the correct audio source is selected in Cap's recording menu. If using QuickTime, verify BlackHole is set as the input device.

**"FaceTime or Zoom audio isn't being captured"**

Some apps have special privacy protections. In Cap, make sure to select "Record entire screen" (not just a window) to capture protected app audio.

**"There's an echo in my recording"**

This happens when your microphone picks up audio playing through your speakers. Either use headphones when recording, or disable the microphone track if you only need system audio.

**"Recording stopped working after a macOS update"**

macOS updates sometimes reset privacy permissions. Check **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording** and re-authorize Cap.

## Tips for Better Screen Recordings

**Use headphones when narrating.** Prevents echo between your microphone and speakers when recording system audio.

**Record at 60fps for demos.** Cap supports high frame rate recording — enable it in settings for smoother animations and cursor movement.

**Trim before sharing.** Cap's built-in editor lets you cut the first few seconds (where you're getting set up) and the last few (awkward pauses before you remember to stop).

**Add a custom background.** If you're recording a window rather than full screen, Cap can add padding and a custom background color or gradient to make it look more polished.
