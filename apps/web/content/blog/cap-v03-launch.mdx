Hey everyone,

It's been four months since we launched Cap's public beta, and I'm excited to announce the release of Cap v0.3.0. This is a completely new version of Cap, rebuilt from the ground up based on your feedback and our vision for the future.

## What's New in v0.3.0?

We've rebuilt the entire app from the ground up, focusing on
what matters most: making screen recording and sharing as effortless and powerful as possible.

### 1. Video Editing

One of the biggest additions is the ability to edit your recordings. You can now trim and completely customise your recordings with custom padding, backgrounds and more. We've worked hard to make these features intuitive and easy to use, even if you've never edited a video before.

### 2. Local-First Approach

We've shifted to a local-first approach, prioritising your privacy and speed. Your recordings and edits now happen locally, giving you full control and faster performance.

### 3. Improved User Interface

We've refined the Cap interface to make it even more user-friendly. The new design is clean, modern, and focuses on what matters most - creating and sharing great videos.

### 4. Quick Sharing

Sharing your recordings is now even easier. Once you're happy with your video, you can get a shareable link with just one click.

### 5. Screenshots

We've added a new feature that allows you to take screenshots of your desktop. Just like sharing screen recordings, you can easily share your screenshots with a single click.

## What's Coming Next?

We're not stopping here. We're already working on some exciting features for future releases:

- Cap AI (for generating descriptions and titles)
- Password protected videos
- Custom domains
- Embeddable videos
- Team sharing (Slack, Discord integrations, etc)
- Screenshot editor
- Automatic zoom / pan to focus

## Your Feedback is Crucial

Cap is open source, built with our community in mind, and your input is invaluable. I'd love to hear what you think about v0.3.0 and what you'd like to see in future updates. Join the [Cap Discord](https://discord.gg/y8gdQ3WRN3) to chat with me and other users.

Thank you for being part of the Cap journey. We're just getting started, and I'm thrilled to have you along for the ride.

As always, feel free to reach out with any thoughts or feedback. My inbox is always open.

Cheers,

Richie McIlroy — Founder of Cap
