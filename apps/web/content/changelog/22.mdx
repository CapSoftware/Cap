- Audio inputs with high sample rates (>48khz) are now opened with the highest available sample rate supported by the encoder.
  This should fix issues that have been reported with Macbook Pro mics and some high-end audio interfaces.
- Sample rate selection now orders the options from highest to lowest, as opposed to randomly
- Editing the cursor size was accidentally enabled, it's now disabled but will be coming back soon
- Color inputs now look good in dark mode
