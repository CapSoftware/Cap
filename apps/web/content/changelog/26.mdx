- Fixes 'Remove Config' button not actually removing the config
- Fixes hanging when creating shareable links
- Adds the experimental new exporter, which should be more reliable than the current exporter.
  You can use it by holding cmd + shift when clicking Export, Create Shareable Link, etc.
- Removes some unused dependencies, making Cap.app 50mb smaller
