------

* **Quicker exports** — export pipeline optimizations cut total export time by ~**16%**
* **macOS Tahoe support** — high-quality SVG Tahoe cursor icons, and fresh macOS Tahoe wallpapers
* **Bluetooth playback fixed** — improved audio latency handling & lag on wireless headphones
* **Fixed audio device selection** — better mic device detection (e.g., AirPods now appear reliably)
* **Snappier uploads** — optimistic presigned URLs reduce upload latency
* **New uploader** — the **new uploader** is now on by default for **Instant Mode**, increasing upload reliability
* **Safer pausing** — enforce monotonic PTS for audio/video to prevent corruption after pauses in Instant Mode
* **Zoom workflow upgrades** — split **Zoom** and **Scene** segments, fixed an issue with clicking zooms segments on long recordings, and you can now drag to create new zoom segments;
* **Multi-monitor improvements** — tighter Target Select overlay bounds and corrected List View in the new recording picker (enable via Settings > Experimental)
* **Stabler capture/encode** — don't abort if the capturer stalls, proper DXVA2 hardware decode on Windows, and handle "no frames" from screen capture
* **Hide inactive cursor** — you can now set cursor idle time in the editor, automatically hiding the cursor after X amount of seconds with a smooth fade
* **Editor UX touches** — scissors cursor shows when the Clip tool is active
* **Quality of life** — On Windows, the main window now re-opens after closing Settings/Editor
