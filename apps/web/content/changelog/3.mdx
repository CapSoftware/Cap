With this update, we've added support for taking screenshots.

Just like screen recordings, you can copy to clipboard, save, or create a shareable link.

You can take a screenshot by clicking in the tray menu, or the dedicated button in the main Cap window.

Next update will include shortcut support for taking screenshots and a basic editor (for cropping, adding effects, etc).
