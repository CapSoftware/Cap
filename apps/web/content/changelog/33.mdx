- The editor now uses a more perforant video decoder that provides much smoother playback and seeking.
  If you experience any issues loading the editor, please let us know.
- Zoom segments now behave as expected and transition smoothly between each other.
- Logs generated during recording are now captured and written to `{recording_path}/recording-logs.log`.
- Camera capture has been simplified such that it should use slightly less CPU.
