* Complete camera system overhaul, enabling broader device support, lower latency and smoother performance
* Experimental: Auto zoom segments automatically inserts new zoom segments at key moments. 
* Cursors now render as high-resolution SVGs for better quality (when available)
* Configurable countdown before recording starts (3, 5 or 10 seconds)
* Export dialog now shows exact output resolution before you render
* Recording halts if sustained frame drops are detected (so you are aware earlier that the recording has stopped)
* On Windows, launching Cap again jumps straight to the recorder instead of opening a second instance
* Refreshed settings pages design
* Edit the name of a recording directly in the editor

Enable "Experimental" features via Settings > Experimental.
