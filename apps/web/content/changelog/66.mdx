- We've built an entirely new camera backend to allow for greater device support, less bugs, and better performance.
- A countdown can now be shown before recording starts. Configurable via settings.
- Windows: Starting the app while it's already running will open the recording window
- When available, cursors will now be rendered as high resolution SVGs instead of their captured images.
- Automatic generation of zoom segments based on cursor clicks is now available as an experimental feature.
