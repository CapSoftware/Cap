* New **List View** in the recording picker (enable via **Settings → Experimental**).
* Faster recording start on macOS by sharing ScreenCaptureKit warm-up across sessions
* Windows capturer now runs on a dedicated thread for snappier, more reliable capture
* Windows encoding is more resilient: automatic fallback to software H.264 when hardware `ProcessInput` fails, plus fixes to the software path
* Auto-zoom feels smoother on fast cursor moves with refined segment generation and steadier cursor behavior (including safer cursor-actor cleanup)
* Fixed a case where the **5-minute Studio export limit** could be enforced incorrectly
* Improved app icon/logo render quality in the new recording picker on Windows
* Added minidump crash reporting (Sentry via Tauri) to help diagnose rare crashes.
* Clearer “needs input” error handling in the desktop flow.
* Improved recording pipeline under the hood for improved reliability and lower latency
