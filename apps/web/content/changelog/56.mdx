- Exported videos now use AAC audio for compatability with social sites
- Video quality can be controlled with compression options
- Recordings on macOS now use native resolution again
- Recording bitrate is no longer a fixed value, so higher resolution displays should use higher bitrates
- (Experimental) Cursor capture now accounts for window and area offsets
