* **New Window Excluder** — hide specific apps/windows from recording (works best on macOS, enable via Settings → General)
* **Camera & mic safety** — we now hold device locks **only while recording is active**, preventing “device busy” conflicts and improving handoff between sessions
* **Multi-channel USB audio** — proper support for interfaces with multiple input channels
* **More faithful color** — AVFoundation recordings now use the **Rec.709 color space** for better color accuracy on modern displays
* **Stronger uploads** — the **new uploader** is enabled on desktop, and we’ve added **multipart uploads** for Studio recordings and Instant re-uploads to handle large files and spotty networks
* **Corruption guard** — the muxer now stops cleanly if a frame queue failure occurs, avoiding partial or corrupted outputs
* **Clearer errors** — improved messaging and handling when video upload info can’t be found
* **Under-the-hood reliability** — numerous recording pipeline hardening tweaks for steadier performance
