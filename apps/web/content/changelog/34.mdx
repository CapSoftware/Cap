- A crop option is now available when preparing to record a screen, allowing you to record only a portion of the screen.
  Thanks to @ItsEeleeya for contributing this!
- Audio inputs with with >2 channels can now be recorded. The first 2 channels will be recorded as stereo, the rest will be discarded.
- Audio encoding during export is now done with macOS's built-in AAC encoder
- If any part of the recording pipeline (capture or encode) fails, the recording will be immediately stopped
- Webview devtools are now exposed
