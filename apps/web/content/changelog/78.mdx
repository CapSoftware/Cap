- **New Instant Mode Resolution Picker** — You can now set the resolution of Instant Mode recordings in Settings. Choose from 720p, 1080, 1440p and 4k. Defaults to 1080p.
- **Uploader speed improvements** — Uploads are now done more efficiently by uploading multiple chunks at the same time, bumping the chunk size to 20mb, and reusing the presigned URL for the last chunk
- **Audio recording fixes** — A bug that caused recorded audio to sound choppy should now be fixed
- **Upload logs feedback** — Using the 'Upload Logs' tray button will show a dialog if the logs upload succeeds
- **Improved area selector** — Drag to select now supported in the new recording flow area selector (enable new recording flow via Settings -> Experimental)
- **Improved error handling** — Some errors that can occur while recording on Windows will now safely stop recording
