- **Screenshot Mode** — Capture and edit screenshots with a dedicated editor. Includes shapes, text annotations, sensitive masking, backgrounds, padding, and more. Export or share with a single click.
- **Local caption generation** — Generate captions directly on your device using Whisper, with support for many languages. Fully customizable styling (font, size, color, background, position) and SRT export.
- **New editor track types** — Text overlays, Sensitive Mask, and Highlight tracks give you more creative control over your recordings.
- **Overhauled recording picker** — Brand new target select overlay makes it easier than ever to pick your recording source.
- **Recoverable recordings for Studio Mode** — Recordings are now saved in 3-second chunks. If anything goes wrong, you'll lose at most 3 seconds—full recovery system built in and enabled by default.
- **Circle cursor** — New mobile simulator cursor option for showcasing app demos.

- **Redesigned export page** — New export UI with live preview, render time estimates, and frame-accurate cropping via a timeline slider.
- **Windows reliability** — Hardware compatibility checks, encoder health monitoring with automatic fallback, Media Foundation decoder with D3D11 interop, and Windows fragmented M4S muxer support.
- **Bug fixes** — Fixed memory leak while streaming, split action now respects segment speed, and recordings now use human-readable project names instead of UUIDs + lots more quality of life improvements.
