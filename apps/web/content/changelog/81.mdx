- **Speed modification** - Clip segments now have a Speed option in the editor, allowing them to be slowed down or sped up. Currently, changing the speed of a segment will mute its audio.
- **New Crop UI** - Thanks to @ItsEeleeya the area select and editor crop UI now has more features and is much smoother.
- **Bug fixes** - macOS recording errors should be less common, and some recordings should no longer look distorted in the Editor
