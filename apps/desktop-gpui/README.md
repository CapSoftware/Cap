# cap-desktop-gpui

Cap's desktop app, rewritten in [gpui](https://www.gpui.rs/). No Tauri, no
webview — the whole UI is drawn by gpui and every pixel is Rust.

This is milestone 1: **the main recording window**, compact and expanded, with
real device enumeration. It is a parallel implementation, not a replacement.
`apps/desktop` is untouched and remains the shipping app.

## Running it

```sh
cd apps/desktop-gpui
cargo run
```

`RUST_LOG=cap_gpui=debug cargo run` for logs — note the filter is `cap_gpui`
(the binary), not `cap_desktop_gpui` (the package).

The first build takes a few minutes and about 8 GB of `target/`: gpui pulls its
own revisions of the wgpu and font stacks. Incremental builds after that are
under a second.

### Why it is a separate workspace

`Cargo.toml` declares its own `[workspace]`. The root workspace carries
`[patch.crates-io]` entries — a vendored `wgpu-hal`, a forked `tao` — that exist
only for the Tauri app and that gpui's tree does not want. Nesting a second
workspace here leaves the root `Cargo.lock`, the `cargo hakari` workspace-hack
and CI completely untouched.

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins `stable` rather than the root's 1.88.0, because
gpui's dependencies need 1.89+ (`smol_str` 0.3.6, `cosmic-text` 0.19). The
nearest toolchain file wins, so the Tauri app is unaffected.

## What is implemented

Everything below is real, not mocked.

- **Window shell.** Undecorated, transparent, 16px rounded, fixed size. Custom
  header with hand-drawn traffic lights and a scoped drag region.
- **Compact and expanded layouts.** 330×395 and 600×660. Expanding adds section
  headings, turns the capture tiles horizontal with descriptions, widens the
  control rhythm from 8px to 10px, and reveals Recents.
- **Device enumeration.** Cameras via `cap-camera`, microphones via the Cap
  `cpal` fork, displays and windows via `scap-targets` — the same crates the
  recorder uses, so the identities are the ones `cap-recording` expects. Camera
  rows show the device's best advertised format, microphone rows the config the
  device would actually open with.
- **Pickers.** Camera, microphone, display and window, each a full-body panel
  with a live filter field. Displays and windows render as a two-column card
  grid with real refresh rates and bounds.
- **Mode selector**, with the info panel behind its dot.
- **Light and dark**, following the system appearance, from the app's real
  resolved Radix values.

### Layout fidelity

Metrics are transcribed from `apps/desktop`, not eyeballed, and the Tailwind
class each one came from is quoted in a comment next to it — `pl-3` and
`gap-2.5` are much easier to check against the original than `12.` and `10.`.

The colour tokens are the resolved Radix values **with the dark-mode overrides
from `apps/desktop/src/styles/theme.css` applied**. Six of the dark grays and
`gray-11` are not stock Radix, so regenerating the palette from a Radix crate
would quietly change the app's colours.

## Deviations from the Tauri app

Things that are deliberately different, and why.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Traffic lights are hand-drawn** | The Tauri main window returns `None` from `traffic_lights_position`, which routes it to `decorations(false)`; the lights are HTML there too. `titlebar: None` is the gpui equivalent. Minimize is not drawn, and zoom toggles expand/collapse. |
| **No vibrancy** | The real macOS shell is a translucent material, not `bg-gray-1`. This is the single largest visual gap. |
| **Not always-on-top** | `WindowKind::Floating` is *not* the fix: it floats, but it allocates an `NSPanel`, and a panel hides itself when the app deactivates — the window would vanish the moment you click another app. This needs the AppKit calls `windows.rs` makes, on a normal window. Same for `visible_on_all_workspaces` and the NSPanel level-100 treatment. |
| **Resize snaps** | Expand/collapse changes size in one step. The Tauri app animates over 180ms with an ease-out cubic and re-clamps into the work area. |
| **Panels instead of windows** | Mode info is the 580×340 ModeSelect *window* in the Tauri app; here it is a body panel, because there is only one window so far. The device and target pickers are body panels in both. |
| **No target thumbnails** | Display and window cards render the icon fallback the real card falls back to before its thumbnail arrives. Live previews need the capture pipeline. |
| **Search is minimal** | gpui ships no text input. Ours tracks focus, takes `key_char` so dead keys and option-layouts work, and draws a static 1px caret. No selection, no cursor movement, no blink. Escape clears, then closes. |
| **Plan badge is always "Personal"** | Which of Pro/Commercial applies comes from the license query. There is no auth or license plumbing yet, and claiming a plan would be worse than showing none. |
| **Recents is header + empty state** | Thumbnails need the recordings library. |
| **Window filter is duplicated** | The level-0 listability rule is copied from `cap_recording::sources::screen_capture` rather than imported — that crate drags in ffmpeg and the whole encode stack, which this app has no other reason to build. |

### One gpui trap worth knowing

**Do not touch the window from inside `open_window`'s builder closure.**
`MainWindow::new` runs before the platform window is finished. A `resize` there
produces a window whose viewport disagrees with its scale factor — every `px()`
comes out at exactly twice its size — and a task spawned there updates the model
without ever scheduling a frame. Both failures are silent. Set the initial size
through the bounds passed to `open_window`, and start async work from `main`
once the window handle exists.

## Parity roadmap

Sizes are the Tauri app's, from `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/windows.rs`.

| Window | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Main | 330×395 / 600×660 | **Done** — layout, devices, pickers, modes |
| Camera preview | 460×460 | Not started — needs the camera feed |
| Recording controls | 320×150 | Not started — needs a recording session |
| Target select overlay | per display | Not started — one transparent window per display |
| Window capture occluder | per display | Not started |
| Capture area | per display | Not started |
| Recordings overlay | per display | Not started |
| Mode select | 580×340 | Partial — exists as a panel, not a window |
| Settings | 782×775 (min 780×560) | Not started |
| Upgrade | 950×850 | Not started |
| Onboarding | dynamic, 860–1080 wide | Not started |
| Teleprompter | 560×320 | Not started |
| Editor | 1275×800 | Not started — by far the largest |
| Screenshot editor | 1240×800 (min 800×600) | Not started |

Nothing here records yet. Milestone 1 is the window; wiring the buttons to
`cap-recording` is milestone 2.

## Verifying changes

`screencapture` cannot see windows without Screen Recording permission, but
per-window capture by id works. Get the window number from
`CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` and then:

```sh
screencapture -x -o -l<window-id> shot.png
```

Measure against it rather than trusting the eye — the 2×-scale bug above was
invisible until the compact and expanded headers were compared pixel by pixel.
