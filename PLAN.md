# Effect Rewrite

[Effect](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect) is a framework for TypeScript that provides typed dependency injection,
typed error handling, utilities such as RPC, HTTP clients and servers, schema validation, and more.

It's very powerful, and we'd like to start using it in our NextJS project in apps/web.
